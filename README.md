# Notes

This is a collection of notes related to (mostly) discrete dynamic choice but also a bit of dynamic programming in general. My goal is to make some of these difficult techniques more accessible and intuitive. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

1. Discrete Dynamic Choice: Partial Equilibrium Models

* [Partial Equilibrium (R)](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/Notes/576a86eae2c32aba414d87f2e5feb28b37644936/discrete_choice/finitehorizon_dsge.html)

* [Partial Equilibrium (Julia)](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/Notes/d0154d957cbb0275eddc2f42f245014a1c6929f9/discrete_choice/partial_eq_julia.html)

Note that the R version is a bit more complete as of now (with comments on the code) -- I will get to updating the Julia version eventually.
