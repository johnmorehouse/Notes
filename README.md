# Notes

This is a collection of notes related to (mostly) discrete dynamic choice but also a bit of dynamic programming in general. My goal is to make some of these difficult techniques more accessible and intuitive. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

1. [Discrete Dynamic Choice Part 1: Partial Equilibrium (R)](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/Notes/576a86eae2c32aba414d87f2e5feb28b37644936/discrete_choice/finitehorizon_dsge.html)

[Discrete Dynamic Choice Part 1: Partial Equilibrium (Julia)](https://rawcdn.githack.com/johnmorehouse/Notes/59083dd9117ace76ecae994a9d605e7c0287d84f/discrete_choice/Discrete Dynamic Choice.html)

Note that the R version is a bit more complete as of now (with comments on the code) -- I will get to updating the Julia version eventually.
